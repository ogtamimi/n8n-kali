## Security Best Practices for Users

To keep your deployment secure, we recommend:

- Always run the latest image version  
- Avoid exposing n8n directly to the internet  
- Use reverse proxies (NGINX/Traefik) with SSL  
- Change default environment variables immediately  
- Use strong webhook secrets and credentials  
- Restrict container permissions whenever possible  
- Update system packages regularly

## Hardening the Container

Our Kali-n8n image includes:

- Minimal required capabilities  
- Latest Linux security patches  
- Isolated environment for command execution  
- Support for additional tools installed by the user  
- Non-root execution where possible  
- Optional root mode for full Kali workflows

If you notice unsafe defaults or want to suggest improvements, contact us privately.
